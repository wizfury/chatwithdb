# ChatDB
An interactive chatbot to query MySQL databases through natural language. It uses an SQL chain that translates user queries into SQL commands, making database interactions more intuitive and efficient.

## Key highlights:

I've,
- Utilized LangChain to build a natural language interface for querying databases.

- Developed a SQL chain to generate queries from user input.

- Enhanced the chatbotâ€™s natural language understanding and response accuracy using Mistral AI.
